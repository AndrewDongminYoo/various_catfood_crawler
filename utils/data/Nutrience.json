            "Indoor cats love to lounge and have a less active lifestyle than that of an outdoor cat. Providing them a diet rich in quality meat protein and moderate levels of fat will help them maintain a healthy weight and lean muscle mass. Quality chicken is always the first ingredient in our Nutrience Original formulas.",
            "Indoor cats tend to spend more time grooming and shed more than other cats. Our fish & flaxseed omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids will help your cat maintain a healthy skin and coat and reduce excess shedding. In addition, we’ve included a multi-fiber blend and pineapple to minimize the formation of hairballs.",
            "We’ve included key sources of antioxidants in our formulas (blueberries, cranberries and carrots along with vitamin C and vitamin E) that work together to support your cat’s immune system and maintain a healthy heart.",

Gently air dried and minimally processed to give you the very best Canada has to offer. Feed as a meal, add as a topper or offer as a treat. What is air drying? Inspired by raw diet, air drying is a preservation method that eliminates the moisture for microbial growth without the use of high temperatures. This method results in shelf-stable, highly palatable food, and preserves vital nutrients, offering nutrition similar to a raw diet. Air drying: Moisture is removed via the process of evaporation. Ingredients are placed into drying chambers, where air is continually circulated, slowly and gently evaporating moisture until a maximum level of 14% is reached. With higher moisture than freeze-dried, air dried diets offer scoop & feed convenience.
